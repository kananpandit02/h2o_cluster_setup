Steps to Create H2O Cluster:

         1. Create a Virtual Env in a folder and open the Env
         2. sudo apt update
         3. sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk (H2O requires Java 8 or later)
         4. Check Java Version by: java -version and javac -version
         5. pip install h2o
         6. For multinode setup download H2O Version manually: 
            wget https://h2o-release.s3.amazonaws.com/h2o/3.46.0.7 -O h2o-latest.zip unzip h2o-latest.zip
            
            or, go to chrome and search by "h2o 3.46.07" and download the file and unzip it.
         7. keep the unzip file in the folder in the directory of Virtual env.
         8. move h2o.jar file from folder "h2o-3.46.0.6" to the directory of Virtual env.
         9. Create a flatfile (named h2o_flatfile.txt contains all IP addresses of nodes which you want to make a cluster) and keep that file in the env location.
         10.Run the code in termianl in env enviournment : java -Xmx2g -jar h2o.jar -name <give a Cluster Name> -port 54323 -flatfile h2o_flatfile.txt -network 172.20.252.0/24
         11. open another terminal of env directory, activate Virtual Env and Run a ML Programme(e.g. sample_prog.py)
         12. Shutdown the Cluster.

network 172.20.252.0/24
ChatGPT said:
The network address 172.20.252.0/24 you provided refers to a CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation, which specifies an IP address range.

What does 172.20.252.0/24 mean?
172.20.252.0 is the network address.
/24 is the subnet mask, indicating that the first 24 bits of the IP address are used for the network portion, and the remaining 8 bits are used for the host portion.
In practical terms:

172.20.252.0/24 defines an IP range from 172.20.252.0 to 172.20.252.255 (inclusive), giving you 256 possible IP addresses in that subnet (172.20.252.1 to 172.20.252.254 are usable for devices/hosts).
Breakdown:

Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
Usable IP Range: 172.20.252.1 to 172.20.252.254
Broadcast Address: 172.20.252.255
Network Address: 172.20.252.0
This means that devices connected to this network will have IP addresses within this range, and they can communicate directly with each other without needing a router, as long as they're part of the same subnet.

Use in H2O Setup

If you're setting up an H2O cluster with the -network 172.20.252.0/24 option, you are specifying that H2O should discover and communicate with other nodes within the same IP range (172.20.252.1 to 172.20.252.254).

Hereâ€™s how it works:

The master node of the H2O cluster will be assigned an IP within the range (e.g., 172.20.252.53).
The worker nodes should be in the same range and also be able to communicate with the master node (e.g., 172.20.252.54, 172.20.252.55, etc.).
H2O will automatically try to discover and join the nodes within this subnet.
Example of Using -network in H2O:
If you have multiple nodes, you can use the -network option to ensure that your nodes are within the correct IP range. For example:
=======================================================================================


On Node 1 (Master Node):


java -Xmx2g -jar h2o.jar -name trial1 -port 54323 -flatfile h2o_flatfile.txt -network 172.20.252.0/24


On Node 2 (Worker Node):

java -Xmx2g -jar h2o.jar -name trial1 -port 54323 -flatfile h2o_flatfile.txt -network 172.20.252.0/24 -peer 172.20.252.53:54323\


In this example:

Node 1 is the master and runs H2O with the IP range 172.20.252.0/24.
Node 2 connects to the master node using the -peer option and will join the H2O cluster.


Additional Considerations:

Networking Setup: Make sure that all nodes in the cluster can ping each other and that no firewall is blocking communication on port 54323 (or whatever port H2O uses).
Subnet Configuration: Ensure that your subnet is correctly configured and that all nodes are in the same network.
Let me know if you need more details on configuring the network or H2O cluster setup!
